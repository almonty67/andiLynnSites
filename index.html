					<h3>Introduction</h3>
				     <p class="text-justify">Hi there! My name is Andrea Lynn Monty. Everyone calls me Andi. Andi Lynn
				                         comes from
				             when I did a good job at something. So here I am, A Junior Web Developer! I learned Web Development through online courses and have absolutely
				                   fallen in love with it! This is my first project that started out as Hello World! and morphed into my professional website for building responsive web applications and static websites. I am in the process learning Ruby so I can develop the back end of my websites. I have a team which includes, my Fiancé, <strong>Bob</strong>,who is a Senior Network Enginer. My daughter, <strong>Holly</strong>, loves photography and has a great camera eye so the photos on projects would be my daughter's. All of us together work as a team and you can expect nothing but complete professionalism from us. When you are ready for your website to be developed, designed, kept secure and/or updated shoot us an email, we would love to hear from you!!</p>

				    <h3>How I Got Started</h3>
				    <p class="text-justify">I tried a few years ago to build my own e-Commerce website and, well it
				                           was a
				                disaster to say the least. Now this was way before Wordpress Themes and the like became the "in" thing. I wound up hiring a great web developer by the name of Danie Lyn, who in my opinoin is an awesome web developer. Your probably asking yourself, "why promote another web developer on you site? ". Well I feel that I should support my fellow web developers and designers.

				                  Danie Lyn helped me get my website up and runinng making the website gorgeous. She understood my personality, and what I wanted. 3 years ago she got me interested in how she
				                  got my website to come alive. She doesnt even know this as I never got the chance to tell her. I hope she sees my website and reads this to let her know just how much her devotion to web development became my dream aslo.  I now have the pleasure to do your website along with my awesome team because of my love of making websites come alive!!!<br><br>
				                  Thank you Danie Lyn!!!</p>

<!-- START RESUME -->
		<section id="resume">
			<h3 class=" text-center font-weight-bold resume">Past, Present, and Future</h3>
			<p class="text-justify resume-para">I graduated from Carl Sandburg High School in Orland Park, Illinois in
			                                1985. Senior
			                  year I began
			         my work journey in Fast Food as a cashier at McDonald's. From there I worked at Taco Bell which then began my career in assistant manger positions where I
			   loved and shined. I worked as an assistant manager in the Fast Food industry for 3 years and then changed career paths to Dental Assistant which I dedicated 14 years to. In 1998, I went to Capri Beauty School to become a State Of
			   Illinios Licensed Nail Technician. In 2000 I had a daughter and dedicated my life to her upbringing for 13 years. Then another life changed happened when I got divorced. I had to scramble to find a job. After being out of the work force
			   for so long, and letting my Nail Technician State License go inactive, I went back to the Fast Food industry only to find that things had changed so much and I no longer could handle the work due to a bad lower back and neck problems.
			   During the years of bringing up my daughter, I had started a nail art decal business and wanted to have a website. I tried to do it on my own and but I didn't understand how to do it. I wound up hiring a Web Developer. When the divorce
			   hit I had to let the business go. I met a guy in September 2015 who just happenes to be a Senior Network Engineer. He noticed how much I love to Google anything and everything and how I had such passion when I talked about how I had
			   tried to do my own website. He brought up to me becoming a Web Developer and we looked into numerous online courses, finally going with a pretty good online course for Full Stack Web Developer. I started March 2016 and and can proudly say I have become a Junior Web Developer.</p>

						    I have always loved to problem solve and I am a very analytical thinker. I Google anything and everthing. I had a friend mention that I should look into Web Developing because of my love for Googling. As I looked into it I realized that this is what I
						    tried to do a few years ago when I was wanting to sell some products and wanted a website for it. As I said previously I hired a great Web Developer ( though at the time I had no idea what a Web Developer)and was amazed at
